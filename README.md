HerhangiOT
===============

HerhangiOT is open-source server emulator written in C# for MMORPG called [Tibia](http://www.tibia.com) currently working with 10.76 protocol. HerhangiOT is mainly developed on [The Forgotten Server](https://www.github.com/otland/forgottenserver) project and inspired by [SharpOT](https://github.com/sharpot/sharpot) project. Huge thanks to contributors of these project for creating this opportunity.

### What is Herhangi
Herhangi is the word used in Turkish as English article "any". As an idea "Herhangi" has a special meaning for me that is; anything can be done by anyone, anywhere, anytime if particular person finds motivation and power to work on the cause. 

### Current Status
HerhangiOT is currently in v0.1. Currently project loads all item, map, outfit, vocation, scripting modules and allows players to login into the game. Uses JSON format for storage.

### What's next?
Planning further development, our aim for v0.2 is to release fully functional Open Tibia server that has all capabilities of The Forgotten Server including Lua scripting and MySQL+MSSQL storage engines. For further development stronger C# scripting interface is planned.
